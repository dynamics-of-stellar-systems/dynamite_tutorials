# dynamite_tutorials

These are tutorial notebooks for [DYNAMITE](https://github.com/dynamics-of-stellar-systems/dynamite_release/) - a tool for dynamical and population modelling of stellar systems.

We suggest running them in the following order:

1. running_a_model
2. exploring_model_output
3. parameter_space
4. running_a_grid_of_models
